# Sales_Predictions

Our sales price prediction project aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to the sales price of a property. By analyzing historical sales data from real estate markets, we have gained insights into the performance of different features and identified key factors that are predictive of the sales price.

Using the insights gained from our EDA, we engineered new features that were more predictive of the sales price of a property. For example, we created a feature that captured the proximity to local amenities like schools, parks, and shopping centers.

We then built a machine learning model to predict the sales price of a property based on the factors we had identified. We used techniques like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to build a predictive model that took into account the complex interactions between different features.
By refining our model with real-time data from the real estate market, we were able to provide more accurate predictions and insights into the factors that contribute to the sales price of a property. Our project provides a valuable tool for real estate agents, buyers, and sellers to better understand the market dynamics and make more informed decisions.


# Takeaways

Data Insight: Our sales price prediction project aims to analyze historical sales data from real estate markets to gain insights into the factors that contribute to the sales price of a property. By understanding the relationships between different features and the sales price, we can identify key factors that are predictive of the sales price.

EDA: Exploratory data analysis is an essential step in understanding the relationships between different features and the sales price of a property. We can use techniques like data visualization and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the data, such as how the sales price varies by location, property size, age, and other relevant features.

Feature Engineering: After gaining insights from our EDA, we can engineer new features that are more predictive of the sales price of a property. For example, we can create features that capture the proximity to local amenities like schools, parks, and shopping centers, or we can engineer features that capture the quality of the property, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.

Model Building: With our engineered features, we can build a machine learning model to predict the sales price of a property based on the factors we have identified. We can use techniques like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to build a predictive model that takes into account the complex interactions between different features.

Refinement: By refining our model with real-time data from the real estate market, we can provide more accurate predictions and insights into the factors that contribute to the sales price of a property. We can also use techniques like feature selection and regularization to improve the performance of our model and make it more robust to new data.
